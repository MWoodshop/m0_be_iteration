# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
If we have an array with a lot of information but only want a person's name for example this is one way to quickly do that.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
Nailing down the order in which the various components we've learned go together. With more practice and use I will get it.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
I googled real world examples of how this method could be used which helped me to understand how it can be useful. Like asking for a word to be used in a sentence in a spelling bee.
